A couple years ago I was very ambitious and just learning about web development.
I made a GitHub account and soon after found out about GitHub Pages. I had a
static site that I was hosting with GoDaddy for a small fee, so realizing that
I could host my static site for free was a game-changer.

This approach worked for a little while. Then my site started to get too big to
manually make `html` files for each of my pages and projects. I read about
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a really awesome static site generator that
works really well with GitHub Pages, and decided to use it to make my site. As
a long time Linux user, it was easy for me to set up and get my site live.

That brings me here. I used to have my blog in the same Jekyll site as my ePortfolio
that I was required to make for a freshman year college course. The issue with that
site was that I am a back-end developer. I wanted to make my entire ePortfolio
from scratch with a little help from Bootstrap. We'll just say that it didn't look
great. I thought desiging my own site would show everyone that I was an all-around
developer.

So today I decided to move my entire blog to a new repository, using a beautiful
theme from [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/). There was already a Jekyll
port for this theme, but I made some pretty hefty changes to it. I figured that
this way, I can spend less time trying to make my blog look good, and more time
writing about things I love, and things that I am good at.

Consider this an introduction to my new blog! Welcome, and I hope you learn
something during your visit.
