I know that when I first found out I got accepted into UC's Computer Science program, I figured that I
needed to head straight to Best Buy and pick up a super-powerful PC since I would be running tons of
heavy programs that a cheap PC wouldn't be able to handle.

I ended up buying a PC that was around $800. It has served me well, and it was definately enough to get
me through my 5 years of school, but I realized It could have also been done with a machine as simple
as a Chromebook.

## Note Taking

The main reason that I wanted to purchase a Chromebook, besides the fact that I am a Google fanboy,
was for note taking. I expecting to take advantage of its wildly long battery life and extreme portability
to make my life easier. With everying I use in class having a web client (OneNote, Spotify, Google Docs/Word),
I was able to continue my classroom and studying routines just like when I was using my i7, 8gb RAM Ultrabook.

Google makes sure to integrate Google Docs into ChromeOS very well. You are able to create new documents on
the fly, edit existing documents while offline, and thanks to the 100gb storage you get when registering
your Chromebook, back up just about any kind of file in your Drive.
