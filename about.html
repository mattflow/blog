<p>
  My name is Matt Flowers! I am a Student at the University of Cincinnati in the
  gorgeous state of Ohio. I am going into my fourth year of school, but I still
  have (involunatrily) one year to go. I am studying Computer Science and plan
  on graduating with Bachelor's Degree and two years of full-time experience.
</p>

<p>
  As a member of the College of Engineering and Applied Scienes, I am required
  to complete five semesters of full-time internships over five years in order to graduate.
  I have completed three of the five as a Backend Developer for DeVore Technologies.
  During my time with DeVore, I focused on C# and .NET Development for multiple clients.
</p>

<p>
  My development outside of work is focused around Node.js. This usually means
  an Express API and a ReactJS/Angular client. I also like software development
  using C++. I am currently getting more familiar with Python since I find machine
  learning fascinating.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of that boring computer stuff, I enjoy travel and would like to see
  as much of the world as possible. I think photography is cool since it doesn't
  require drawing skills (because I don't have any), but I can't justify buying an expensive
  camera at the moment. I also like casually playing/watching sports.
