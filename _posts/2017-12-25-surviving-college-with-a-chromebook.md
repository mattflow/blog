I know that when I first found out I got accepted into UC's Computer Science program, I figured that I
needed to head straight to Best Buy and pick up a super-powerful PC since I would be running tons of
heavy programs that a cheap PC wouldn't be able to handle.

I ended up buying a PC that was around $800. It has served me well, and it was definately enough to get
me through my 5 years of school, but I realized It could have also been done with a machine as simple
as a Chromebook.

## Note Taking

The main reason that I wanted to purchase a Chromebook, besides the fact that I am a Google fanboy,
was for note taking. I expecting to take advantage of its wildly long battery life and extreme portability
to make my life easier. With everying I use in class having a web client (OneNote, Spotify, Google Docs/Word),
I was able to continue my classroom and studying routines just like when I was using my i7, 8gb RAM Ultrabook.

Google makes sure to integrate Google Docs into ChromeOS very well. You are able to create new documents on
the fly, edit existing documents while offline, and thanks to the 100gb storage you get when registering
your Chromebook, back up just about any kind of file in your Drive.

## Programming

This area is what I thought would be the biggest problem when switching to my
chromebook for full-time schoolwork. I did a bit of research and I was able
to come across a bunch of different ways to program in any language you would like.
These are some of the approaches I came across while figuring out which I like the
best.

### 1. Online IDE

An online IDE is exactly what it sounds like. A full development environment inside
of your web browser. Most of these online environments are ususally just a full linux
installation with a terminal, file navigator, and text editor.

There are many different websites and services that provide an online environment for
programming but my favorite is Cloud9. Cloud9 is completely free with the option to
purchase more powerful environments or an environment with more disk space. Cloud9
provides the user with everything they need to most development. You really get your
own linux virtual machine and you can install anything you would like on it.

The only thing that you are unable to do is develop .NET applications. Even with
the cross platform .NET Core, the initial package restore takes up all space on
the VM if you are using the free tier.

### 2. Crouton

If an online IDE is not your thing, you can take it a step further and install
linux right on your chromebook. This is by far my favorite way to program on
my chromebook. Crouton is a very large script written by a Google employee. It
takes the extremely messy process of install linux under a mountable chroot and
makes it very elegant. Once you use crouton to install a chroot, you can simply open
the chromeos developer shell and boot into your new linux installation.

### 3. SSH

This approach will only work for a specific group of people. This works for someone
who is okay with developing straight from a terminal only (I'm talking about you,
vim users), and people who have access to a server they can ssh into. There are useful
chrome apps that are ssh clients and using these, you can ssh into any server that
you have access to. Since my school provides the students with a development server,
I often found myself logging in in order to get some development done.

## Entertainment

The last thing that is very important to me is entertainment. When I am done with
schoolwork and I want to sit back and relax, I go to websites like Netflix, YouTube,
and Twitch. So I really just need a machine that can stream light video. When first
getting my chromebook, it streamed video with no problems. It was fast, great quality,
and it never heated up in my lap. I recently ran
into performance issues and I was not able to
stream video without constant studdering. I just
opened the task manager and noticed that an
extension was using more CPU than it should be.
All I had to do was reinstall the extension and
the problem was solved.

## Decision Time

For anyone who isn't required to use heavy duty programs, I think a chromebook
is your best bet. So far in my four years of college, I have not used any program
or had to do any programming that couldn't be done on my chromebook, and online
IDE, or a light xubuntu installation on my machine. I will say that I am a complete
linux head, so if you are unfamiliar with development on linux, most of the 
programming options I listed above might be difficult for you and require a bit
of research. If you are headed off to college and you don't want to spend a fortune on a Macbook,
give the simple chromebook a consideration.
